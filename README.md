## Install ImageMagick 

1. Download and install ImageMagick for Windows from the official website: https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php. Make sure to check the "Install legacy utilities (e.g. convert)" option during the installation process.

2. After installing ImageMagick, you need to find the path to the `magick` binary. It is usually located in the installation folder, for example: `C:\Program Files\ImageMagick-7.1.0-Q16-HDRI\magick.exe` (the version number may be different).

3. Replace the path with the correct path to your `magick.exe` file inside the `config.py`.
